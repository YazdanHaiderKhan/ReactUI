# ReactUI — My First React Project

A simple, clean, component-based UI built with **React + Tailwind CSS**.  
This project uses **dynamic props** and **array-based data rendering** to structure components in a scalable and readable way.

Not fully responsive or functional yet — this is the first step in my React journey.
